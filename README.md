# Maintainer Week

## A week for open source maintainers to gather, share, and be celebrated. ü•≥

**<p align="center"> ‚ùáÔ∏è Week of June 7, 2021 ‚ùáÔ∏è </p>**

**Welcome to Maintainer Week!**

Open Source runs the world. But runs open source? Who is there, day by day, to coordinate keeping it running? Open Source project maintainers make the software we use possible. But project maintenance is intense work - and it doesn‚Äôt happen in a vacuum.

Maintainer week is a reminder for the ecosystem to support, celebrate, and compensate open source maintainers.

Maintainer week is an opportunity for maintainers to gather and share knowledge and experiences. It‚Äôs a time to see how other projects are tackling similar problems. And it‚Äôs a time to reflect collectively that the challenges faced aren‚Äôt all technical, and the burden on maintainers can come with a lack of boundaries, vacations, or emotional support. Whether you‚Äôre celebrating contributions to open source, or reflecting on the particular pains of this line of labor, this is a week to come together.

### What‚Äôs going on during Maintainer Week? How do I get involved?

This is an open source initiative to bookmark a week to collectively contemplate open source maintainership, whatever form that takes. Various organizations, projects, and companies will be running activities, events, and distributing resources. Submit a PR to list what you‚Äôre planning, so that folks can come participate. Anyone can plan or add something. No-one owns Maintainer Week - it‚Äôs for _everyone_.

Some examples of what folks are doing:
- Posting on social media to thank the maintainers of their favorite open source projects
- Recording special Podcast episodes
- Organizing special-edition open working group meetings
- Streaming live on Twitch
- Hosting mini-events
- Convening tool-specific maintainer summits
- Pledging to to donate to support Open Source

And next - enjoy! See the list below to plan your week.
