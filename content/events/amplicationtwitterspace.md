Amplication is an open source, low code development tool. It helps you develop quality Node.js applications without spending time on repetitive coding tasks.
With Amplication, you can:

- Easily create data models and configure role-based access control with a simple and intuitive UI or CLI
- Continuously push the generated application to your GitHub repository
- Get a Docker container with your database, a Node.js application and a React client
- Join Michael Solati and @blackgirlbytes on Friday, June 17 at 3pm EDT on Twitter Spaces at: https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDxlgQqdnzJL
