# Maintainer Week 
## A week for open source maintainers to gather, share, and be celebrated.

Week of June 7, 2021

Welcome to Maintainer Week.

Open Source runs the world. But who holds the reins? Who is there, day by day, to coordinate keeping it running? Open Source project maintainers make the software we use possible. But project maintenance is intense work - and it doesn’t happen in a vacuum. 

Maintainer week is a reminder for the ecosystem to support, celebrate, and compensate open source maintainers.

Maintainer week is an opportunity for maintainers to gather and share knowledge and experiences. It’s a time to see how other projects are tackling similar problems. And it’s a time to reflect collectively that the challenges faced aren’t all technical, and the burden on maintainers can come with a lack of boundaries, vacations, or emotional support. And it definitely doesn’t come with dental.

**What’s going on during Maintainer Week? How do I get involved?**

This is an open source initiative to bookmark a week to collectively contemplate open source maintainership, whatever form that takes. Various organizations, projects, and companies will be running activities, events, and distributing resources. Submit a PR to list what you’re planning, so that folks can come participate. Anyone can plan or add something. No-one owns Maintainer Week - it’s for everyone.

Some examples of what folks are doing:
- Recording special Podcast episodes
- Organizing special-edition open working group meetings
- Streaming live on Twitch
- Hosting mini-events
- Convening tool-specific maintainer summits
- Pledging to to donate to support Open Source

And next - enjoy! See the list below to plan your week.
